Version Control:

git is one of the virtual control system which helps to share the modules of the project with the people through out the organization.


--> records all the changes with the person name
--->helps for collaborative development
--> allows revert changes

3 types of version
local -> stores in local file of a computer. Multi user sharing not possible
centralized -> multi user sharing is possible but depends on centralized storage.
Distributed -> it has both centralized and local repositories. if any one repo or even centralized storage is down it won't effect anything.
Ex: Git,subversion.
